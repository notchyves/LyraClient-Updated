# Lyra Client Updated

This is a version of Lyra Client that will, hopefully if I'm not too lazy, will be updated to the latest version. All DLL builds will be put in releases for each version such as ```1.20.8X```!

Because of the nature of this project, this isn't going to be official, nor will you nessecarily get helped by the [Lyra Client Discord](https://discord.gg/lyraclient), nor will you get helped by me personally for every single issue. Just inject the DLL with an injector such as this [the one made by ambient](https://github.com/ambiennt/MCBE-DLL-Injector). This also may not be consistenly updated too as I have my own projects...

Finally, some features like the Friend System which was originally part of Lyra Client will be removed from any new versions, due to the Lyra Friend System API being most likely indefinetely down, and me not having the knowledge, money, nor time to maintain it myself.

Thank you to the Lyra Client Team for giving me permission, to do this and have a good day :D
